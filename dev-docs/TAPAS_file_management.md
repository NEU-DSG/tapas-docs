TAPAS File Management ## Background ### Managed vs Unmanaged Drupal can treat files as “managed” (they have an entry inthe database, and Drupal keeps track of which modules need them) or “unmanaged”(no database entry, and Drupal does not keep track of them.  TAPAS will use “managed” for the TEI records, and “unmanaged”for the auxillary files. ### File Streams Drupal uses PHP Stream Wrappers for keeping track of files..It provides three default stream wrappers (public://, private://, andtemporary://) and allows the creation of custom wrappers. TAPAS customizes the file handling significantly enough thatwe will create a custom tapas:// stream wrapper, which subclasses private:// ### Public vs Private Tapas can store files as “Public” or “Private”. Accesscontrols can still be used with “Public” files, but those controls can bebypassed by anyone with a direct URL to the file. Using the “Private” filestorage enforces the file permissions by preventing direct links, but addsconsiderable overhead. TAPAS will use the “Private” file storage, along with anApache extention that will reduce the added overhead. ## Details (wip)
