* Question of how to represent ographies: 
   * Users should be able to decide whether or not the uploaded file should be included as part of the table of contents
   * Will automatically determine what type of ography the file is, whether or not it's an ODD file, all others will be otherOgraphy
* Support files
   * Will continue to only support ancillary image files, not ancillary XML files
   * Future development will include better handling of support documents
* Display for specific fields
   * We do want contributor, author, and title fields to have display names
   * Will be fed to eXist and to Hydra in MODS
* Dates/multiple date fields
   * Source description date is treated as the timeline date. Treat as a display date, which users are allowed to edit
   * If people need more complexity, then we can address that specific complexity in a later version
* Thumbnails
   * Will send for future DRS use
* Unique IDs
   * Will and Linda will handle this
* Deletion
   * Delete after three months. Notifiy users before and allow them to renew.
