Questions
* What are the useful limits of Hydra's capabilities?
* What can Hydra do more effectively? What can the TAPAS head to more effectively than other development options?

TAPAS components
* Community features: forums, lab notes
* Aggregation: projects/collections and their parts
* Management of the pieces of a TAPAS record
   * TEI files, MODS, TFC, Auxiliary/ancillary files
   * File management: uploading/processing (individual upload, bulk upload)
* Web site user management: permissions, info, authentication
* XML/XSLT handling (eXist): create TFC, MODS, etc
* Search/index/analysis
* File management: uploading/processing (individual upload, bulk upload)
* Reading interface
* User profile and options
* Visualization and analysis tools

Tasks for Will
* Demonstrate that passive Fedora role is working
* Develop parallel Fedora-based file provision (so Drupal does not store files)
