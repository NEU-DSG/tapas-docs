* Linda: Where the project is
  * Updates did break the site, so starting from scratch
  * Eli is working on the theme, Linda is working on the configuration
  * Modules: UI, TEI Upload, Indexing and searching
  * Will is working on a new base box, but he needs an base from Linda
  * Data migration: will be easier when we have a consistent way to set up the environment
  * Site is still down with a splash page for users
 * Site maintenance: Are we bringing up the site as it was?
  * Yes, get it back up as soon as possible with the old theme, then focus on better design in the future
  * ETA for site return? (No good answer)
  * Can the site be brought back up without security updates?
  * Linda: No, security updates are crucial and need to be applied
  * Will: Can we apply it manually? May take less work/time then building from scratch, could take days.
  * Syd: If the SQL Db is vulnerable, can we just check everyday, and if there's an attack we can roll back to the day before?
  * Don't want to make the SQL more vulnerable
  * Linda will do a full restore from backup, get it into maintenance mode, then apply the update manually (Eli thinks this may only be one line of code, but needs to check).
* Site redesign
  * Once Linda, Eli, Will have something to discuss, they'll ask the group for input
  * Eli will scratch the current theme entirely
  * What could have been done differently to make sure the code was being written appropriately.
    * Will: Need to trust your team, could have had team code review. Automatic static PHP quality control?
* Ingestion processes:
  * Transform will happen in eXist
  * Testing, validating will happen Drupal
  * Linda needs to figure out how to run XSLT2 in Drupal
* eXist:
  * eXist instance running for whole library, which will do heavy lifting and pass it back to TAPAS
  * Ashley: 1 instance might be a bad idea:
    * Library instance will need two apps within that handle code for the TAPAS dev and TAPAS live sites
    * Dev instance is fine for playing around in. Security problem could come through the Dashboard (xQuery injections)?
  * Syd: Is the current eXist setup too library-specific? Should the TAPAS data be stored separately, isolated from other library eXist data? Just put the two TAPAS eXist instances on the two TAPAS machines?
  * Patrick will need to be consulted about this question: What is the library's vision for eXist, how should it be configured to prepare for multiple eXist projects, particularly for projects like TAPAS, which contains private data?  
  * Ashley will summarize the recommendation to Patrick (independent TAPAS eXist instances for each TAPAS machine).
