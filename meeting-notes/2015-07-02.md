What metadata to expose on the form, how metadata will be edited:

* Before the TEI file is uploaded, users will be prompted to learn about how we use the TEI data to encourage good TEI header practices
* MODS records will be generated from the TEI header and returned to the interface for users to customize and submit as part of the upload process
* Will still have customizable fields, but they could be a small set of metadata fields (propose smaller set of fields)
* Customized fields will modify the original MODS records with the newly supplied metadata values

Next Steps
* Ben will write up a list of fields that should be presented to users at the point of submission, with a brief description of the field.
* Small metadata team will reconvene to discuss the list and determine what TEI header/MODS fields will be used. 
* Ashley will review and improve the XSLT
