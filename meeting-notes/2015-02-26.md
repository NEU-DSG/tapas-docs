We discussed how to go about making changes to our local, dev, and web environments, especially for database updates and syncing developers' work across local environments.

We also discussed the TFC generation process and where it should happen. Initially the plan was to keep it in Drupal, but it was finally decided that a cleaner solution is to pass the original TEI file and user/system data to eXist for processing (since it's a Java service already running Saxon and XSLT 2.0). eXist would then return the TFC to Drupal, which would send a copy to Hydra to send to Fedora. This can all be done asynchronously from the user upload process.

There's some confusion over whether or not the TFC is actually used in Drupal or if the original TEI file is. Syd thinks it is, but Will thinks not. Regardless, the TFC *should* be used there.

We also decided that eXist should be independent of Hydra in the local dev boxes.
