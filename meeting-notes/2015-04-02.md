## User emails
* info@tapasproject.org is supposed to forward user emails to TAPAS gmail, but it is instead forwarding to Scott.
* Linda: there is a way for Drupal to handle email management, but it probably isn't
* Ben and Linda are working to solve this

## The new TAPAS Drupal
* Eli, Linda and Ben decided to set a 6-month timeline for the new Drupal front- and back-end
	* What needs to be working before the TEI Conference in October?
	* What features do we hope to eventually put in place?
	* Next week's meeting: determine specifics of the timeline
	* Syd: we should concentrate on reimplementing the features that work on the current site, rather than the buggy/prototypal features
* *Linda has wireframes, draws them out on the whiteboard*
	* Linda identified a Drupal extension "Homebox", which gives users a dashboard and some control over widgets
	* Conversations
		* Messages between members, annotations on texts
		* Current forum becomes the Support Forum
			* Community messages on forum will move to the messages function
		* Conversations can be tagged
			* Tags seeded with official values, but can be user-defined
	* Search
		* Initial idea is to distinguish between content searches and TEI/XML-based search
			* Syd: the line between the two is fuzzy
			* Ben: TAPAS needs to support people at different levels of understanding the XML tree structure
		* Advanced search includes faceting
			* Ben: search should reflect research needs. Simple search is used less frequently than advanced search.
				* Can we create a drop-down widget with the features of an advanced search, so that users can access advanced search anywhere?
				* Ashley: An advanced search widget could keep people from using the full Search webpage; need to be careful that the search page does not have more options than the widget
		* Ben: we should include the option to save the results of a search for further research
			* Syd: we should also include the option to save searches
			* Ben: researchers would also want to save collections of results for comparison/different projects
