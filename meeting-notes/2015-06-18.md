Items can belong in multiple collections
* isMemberOf, or alternate relationship?
* Need to set a primary collection
* How will files that are private in one collection be handled in collections that are not private
* In Drupal, the collections handle the privacy of the items contained within, not the file level
* If a file is stored in a public and private collection, the public collection access overrides the private
* Will break the breadcrumbs, but possible to insert "multiple collections" or some such text as a placeholder in the breadcrumbs?
* Deleting a collection does not delete the files, so if a collection is deleted the file that lives in multiple collections would still live.

Development Spec

1. Feature freeze Drupal,
 * Only implement features/updates to:
 * Non-Drupal dependent components (eXist, etc)
 * Drupal components, evaluated on a feature-by-feature basis
2. Migrate to new Drupal
3. Launch TAPAS 2.0
4. Build Hydra

Diagrams/Maps
* Lifecycle of an object
* Knowledge map
* Roadmap
