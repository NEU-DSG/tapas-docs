Subfolders:
 * dev-docs: Development-related documentation
 * public-docs: General and public-facing TAPAS documentation, such as grant proposals and conference papers
 * meeting-notes: Internal meeting notes, unlikely to be of interest
 * tei-upload-and-management: More detailed information for those who are uploading and managing TEI projects within TAPAS.

<!-- The below section should be kept up to date and mirrored across the README.md files in the other TAPAS repositories. -->
