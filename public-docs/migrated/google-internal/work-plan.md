## Work Plan
/The work plans on this page give an overview of the TAPAS development work./

# More detailed work plans for specific areas:

    * Repository development
    * User interface
    * Schemas and stylesheets
    * Documentation and training
    * Outreach, recruiting, and community development
    * Project milestones
    
    


## Immediate tasks
These tasks should be completed by the face-to-face (NEH-funded) meeting at Wheaton on December 5-7, 2012:

    * Interface development for basic ingestion, management, and publication configuration: for review/testing at meeting
    * Full draft data specification for review: metadata to be gathered from users on file upload, what file formats we will support (images, stylesheets, XML, etc.), what features we intend to support in TAPAS 1.0. For the face-to-face meeting, create document that expresses/details all of these points/decisions
    * Draft documentation for test users for upload and publication process
    * Recruit designer, ideally to attend face-to-face meeting


## Immediate followup tasks
These tasks follow immediately after the November meeting, completed by (roughly) end of January 2013:

    * Final version of data specification
    * Profile of test data, rough version of a basic publication stylesheet
    * Public-grade documentation for test users


## By March 2013
These tasks should be completed by the face-to-face meeting tentatively planned for March 2013:

    * Prototype in place for public testing
    * Draft survey ready for review, to be sent to users; results of this survey guide grant proposal due in May 2013
    * Complete draft of business model for review at meeting
    * Refine schemas based on test data for review at meeting
    * Ingestion of test data from project collaborators
    * Refine interface to create a “best wireframe” level of design, ready for detailed engagement by graphic designer
    * Develop publication stylesheets (functional level)
    * Graphic design (Jeremy Boggs if possible; should attend the F2F)


## By end of project
We need to revisit and order/possibly expand this list after January 2013:

    * Development of user documentation and tutorials
    * Further user testing (semi-public?)
    * Refinement of schemas
    * Membership recruiting
    * Finalize user interface
    * Finalize documentation and tutorials
